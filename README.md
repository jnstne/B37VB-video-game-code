# Aidan Johnstone Noughts and Crosses game report

## introduction
for my video game i decided to make my own version of the pre existing noughts and crosses.
its a game made for 2 players to compete and enjoy

## instructions of game

its just a classic game of noughts and crosses where 2 players to go against each other 
to try and get 3 of their shape in a row while simultaniously stopping the other from
doing the same

the controls are shown in the game too but ill explain them here too,

- Player 1 plays as the symbol X
- Player 2 plays as the symbol O

the noughts and crosses grid is split up into 9 sections each with a connected number (1-9).

Player 1 goes first and picks any of the sections they want to start with by typing the number associated with said section.

then Player 2 continues by choosing a different number than what Player 1 chose and the game continues like this.

the game ends when one player gets 3 of their symbols in a row, whether thats up & down, left & right or diagonal.

alternatively the game also ends when all 9 sections have been filled and no winner is found, hence the result is a draw.

when a game is completed a prompt will come up asking the player if they'd like to play again or terminate the run, also any game can be terminated by typing -1.
